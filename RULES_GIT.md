# ‚úÖ Git Rules for the "Heat Diffusion OpenMP" Project

These rules help keep the project clean, organized, and collaborative.

---

## üîÅ 1. Always pull before starting to work

Before you begin coding, **make sure your local copy is up to date**:

```bash
git pull origin main
```

---

## üßπ 2. Commit often with clear messages

Use clear and meaningful commit messages:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Implemented anisotropic diffusion function"
```

‚úÖ Good examples:
- "Created plotting script"
- "Fixed bug in temperature update"
- "Updated documentation"

‚ùå Avoid vague messages like "fix", "changes", or "stuff"

---

## üì§ 3. Only push working code

Always test your code before pushing:

```bash
git push origin main
```

Never push code that:
- Doesn‚Äôt compile
- Breaks the program
- Is partially implemented

---

## üëÄ 4. Review changes before committing

Use these commands to see what you're committing:

```bash
git status       # See modified or new files
git diff         # See exact line changes
```

---

## üì¶ 5. Respect the folder structure

- `src/` ‚Üí C/OpenMP source code
- `data/` ‚Üí input/output files (e.g., CSV)
- `plots/` ‚Üí plots and visualization scripts
- `report/` ‚Üí final report (PDF, TeX)
- `slides/` ‚Üí presentation materials

---

## üö´ 6. Don‚Äôt track temporary files

Make sure `.gitignore` excludes:
- Build artifacts (`*.o`, `*.exe`)
- Output files (`*.csv`, `*.png`, `*.txt`)
- Temporary or IDE folders (`cmake-build-*`, `.idea/`)

---

## üîí 7. Don‚Äôt edit others‚Äô code without notice

If someone else is working on a file, **communicate before editing it**. For major changes, consider using a pull request.
